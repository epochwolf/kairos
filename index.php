<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>Please use common sense and respect others’ right to enjoy the event. Remember that any activity which is illegal outside the event is still illegal inside the event. Event Staff may ask you to stop an activity or take it to a private room. While in public or event spaces, attendees are expected to maintain a “PG-13″ standard of conduct. Repeat offenders may have their membership revoked. Please also note that the event staff retains the right to deny entry to anyone and that you can be asked to leave at any time without warning or particular infraction to these rules of conduct. When in the event area, the public areas of the hotel or restaurants, shirts, footwear and pants or shorts must be worn.  At no time should any attendee wear clothing that is overly revealing, or for blatant sexual/fetish purposes anywhere other than private rooms. Fighting, rough-housing, throwing objects, vandalism of the hotel or other areas, yelling and playing excessively loud music in convention areas may be considered disorderly conduct.</p>

<h3>Badges</h3>
<p>Event attendees will receive a membership badge.  This badge is your ‘proof of membership’ and must be worn visibly at all times during the event.  Staff may ask to see proof of membership at any time.  You may be denied access to events or convention spaces if you do not have a badge. If you lose your badge you must purchase a new badge. Sharing of badges, tampering with names or labels and codes is strictly prohibited. If you violate the code of conduct you may be asked to surrender your badge, there is no refund for additional time.</p>

<h3>Hotel</h3>
<p>As an event attendee, you are a guest of the hotel and must abide by the hotel’s rules and policies whenever you are on the premises, regardless of whether you are staying in a hotel room or not. However, if you are unsure if something is allowed, Hotel Front Desk will be able to assist you. If you are expelled from the hotel for violation of their rules, you immediately forfeit your event membership and must surrender your proof of membership. You are responsible for any damage you cause to hotel property. The event space and public spaces within the hotel are not sleeping areas. This includes hallways, the lobby, parking lot and public restrooms. All hotel policies (such as maximum occupancy) must be observed and abided by at all times.</p>

Any individual found supplying alcohol to minors will have their membership revoked and will be reported to the police.</p>

Attendees purchasing a membership are agreeing to not act as media agents in any way shape or form while attending this event.  Making photographic, audio or video recordings of any convention event for commercial purposes is strictly forbidden.  The only exception to this is any photography taken by convention staff, for the purposes of future show marketing.</p>

<h3>Refund Policy</h3>
<p>No refunds of any kind will be given for memberships.  If you are asked to surrender your badge due to inappropriate behavior the badge fee is forfeit.</p>
